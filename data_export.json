It offers an alternative to policy and security studies by drawing on the perspectives of literary and cultural studies, history, anthropology, ethnography, music, and visual art. Rather than opposing or defending militarization per se, this book focuses attention on how Caribbean people negotiate militarization in their everyday lives. The volume explores topics such as the US occupation of Haiti; British West Indians in World War I; the British naval invasion of Anguilla; military bases including Chaguaramas, Vieques and Guantánamo; the militarization of the police; sex work and the military; drug wars and surveillance; calypso commentaries; private security armies; and border patrol operations.",

Many of the stories first appeared in primitive form in Lopp’s perennially popular blog, Rands in Repose. The Third Edition of Managing Humans contains a whole new season of episodes from the ongoing saga of Lopp's adventures in Silicon Valley, together with classic episodes remastered for high fidelity and freshness. Whether you're an aspiring manager, a current manager, or just wondering what the heck a manager does all day, there is a story in this book that will speak to you—and help you survive and prosper amid the general craziness of dysfunctional bright people caught up in the chase of riches and power. Scattered in repose among these manic misfits are managers, an even stranger breed of people who, through a mystical organizational ritual, have been given power over the futures and the bank accounts of many others. Lopp's straight-from-the-hip style is unlike that of any other writer on management and leadership. He pulls no punches and tells stories he probably shouldn't. But they are magically instructive and yield Lopp’s trenchant insights on leadership that cut to the heart of the matter—whether it's dealing with your boss, handling a slacker, hiring top guns, or seeing a knotty project through to completion. Writing code is easy. Managing humans is not. You need a book to help you do it, and this is it. What You'll Learn Lead engineers Handle conflict Hire well Motivate employees Manage your boss Discover how to say no Understand different engineering personalities Build effective teams Run a meeting well Scale teams Who This Book Is For Managers and would-be managers staring at the role of a manager wondering why they would ever leave the safe world of bits and bytes for the messy world of managing humans. The book covers handling conflict, managing wildly differing personality types, infusing innovation into insane product schedules, and figuring out how to build a lasting and useful engineering culture.",

    "description": "This book is an excellent resource for academics and students interested in ethics and accountability in the public sector, as well as for practitioners, NGO workers and policymakers. Over the last decades, issues in ethical leadership have become central to the global call for higher moral standards on the part of corporate organisations and their leaders and managers. The book’s chapters investigate these concerns in Africa, where governance gaps often reflect poor leadership. Parenthetically, in 2001, a UNDP report found difficulties in applying anti-corruption laws and managing public institutions in the continent. Twenty years on, significant efforts have been made to improve the situation, yet extensive challenges still subsist. In this first volume, contributors discuss the practice of ethics, anti-corruption, and performance management, and propose solutions, some general to the continent and others country-specific.",

    "description": "LOOKED OVER JORDAN is the final volume of the authors Land of Promise trilogy. The rapid and ongoing transition of the American West from frontier to settlement is here, embodied in the lives of Abe Saunders and the women he loves. A Confederate veteran, pioneer, and rancher, he is invited to start up and edit a newspaper in a booming frontier town. In this role, he uses the opportunity to advocate for his Indian friends fight to regain their homeland in Eastern Oregon and Idaho. A career in state politics follows, but his growing prominence threatens the relationships he holds most dear. This multifaceted saga explores love, loss, destiny, our connection to the land, and becoming at home in a place. In the words of one of the next generation of these families, This land we are talking about cannot be owned by any one of us. It is the land of these two families, and it will be for all of us to call home, no matter what the governments papers say or any of the white mans laws have to do with it. What I see is that we are all relatives, all family, and we must trust one another, take care of each other, and honor the grandfathers and grandmothers who made one family out of two families, white and Indian, who made one dream for our generation and for our childrens children. What I want to see is that the memories of our ancestors are honored and respected for as long as we live. Ah ho.\"",

The main paradigms of water resources development are identified as: i) engineering and economic approach to water resources exploitation, ii) focus on pollution control and water-excess management, iii) a comprehensive approach toward a sustainable and equitable distribution of resources and effective risk reduction of water-related disasters. After a section devoted to the analysis of some historic stages in the legislation framework and the governance of water and soil, with particular reference to planning, design, building and operation of water systems, two sections deal with the estimation of water resources availability on national territory and estimation of water demands in municipal, agricultural, industrial, ecosystem sectors. The complex problems that the Italian society has to solve in the water field and the main challenges of a changing world are discussed in the fourth section of the volume. The book will not only be useful for water professionals, but also for citizen who like to discern the key factors which delay the recognition of water as a resource for life. The description of the problems and adopted solutions could also serve as a guideline for similar situations encountered in other countries, improving the preparation of the responsible people.",

    "description": "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the highest energy collider ever built. It resides near Geneva in a tunnel 3.8m wide, with a circumference of 26.7km, which was excavated in 1983-1988 to initially house the electron-positron collider LEP. The LHC was approved in 1995, and it took until 2010 for reliable operation. By now, a larger set of larger integrated luminosities have been accumulated for physics analyses in the four collider experiments: ATLAS, CMS, LHCb and ALICE.The LHC operates with an extended cryogenic plant, using a multi-stage injection system comprising the PS and SPS accelerators (still in use for particle physics experiments at lower energies). The beams are guided by 1232 superconducting high field dipole magnets.Intense works are underway in preparation of the High Luminosity LHC, aimed at upgrading the LHC and detectors for collecting ten times more luminosity, and extending the collider life to the early 2040's. So far, the (HL-)LHC project represents a cumulation of around one hundred thousand person-years of innovative work by technicians, engineers, and physicists from all over the world; probably the largest scientific effort ever in the history of humanity. The book is driven by the realisation of the unique value of this accelerator complex and by the recognition of the status of high energy physics, described by a Standard Model — which still leaves too many questions unanswered to be the appropriate theory of elementary particles and their interactions.Following the Introduction are: three chapters which focus on the initial decade of operation, leading to the celebrated discovery of the Higgs Boson, on the techniques and physics of the luminosity upgrade, and finally on major options - of using the LHC in a concurrent, power economic, electron-hadron scattering mode, when upgraded to higher energies or eventually as an injector for the next big machine. The various technical and physics chapters, provided by 61 authors, characterise the fascinating opportunities the LHC offers for the next two decades ahead (possibly longer), with the goal to substantially advance our understanding of nature.",

Each edition of this classic reference has proved to be a benchmark in the developing field of cognitive neuroscience. The sixth edition of The Cognitive Neurosciences continues to chart new directions in the study of the biological underpinnings of complex cognition—the relationship between the structural and physiological mechanisms of the nervous system and the psychological reality of the mind. It offers entirely new material, reflecting recent advances in the field, covering the latest research, experimental approaches, and measurement methodologies. This sixth edition treats such foundational topics as memory, attention, and language, as well as other areas, including computational models of cognition, reward and decision making, social neuroscience, scientific ethics, and methods advances. Over the last twenty-five years, the cognitive neurosciences have seen the development of sophisticated tools and methods, including computational approaches that generate enormous data sets.

    "description": "Business modelling is a vast arena of research and practice, which is gaining increasing important in the rapid development of e-commerce, globalization, and in particular, the movement toward global e-business. The ability to utilize advanced computing technology to model, analyse and simulate various aspects of ever-changing businesses has made a significant impact on the way businesses are designed and run these days. With the current global e-business and e-commerce initiatives, it has become important that all businesses carefully validate their business objectives, requirements, and strategies through a careful process of formal business modelling. It is important for effective enterprise decision making to have clear, concise business models that allow the extraction of critical value from business processes and specify the rules to be globally enforced. Particularly in e-business specifications, the need to be unambiguous, accurate, and complete becomes even greater, because there may be no human mediator or agent to rely on in complex or unforeseen situations. Business Modelling: Multidisciplinary Approaches - Economics, Operational, and Information Systems Perspectives, arranged in three parts, brings scholarly perspectives from various disciplines to bear on some of the critical aspects of business modeling. The first part (chapters 1-8) focuses on business modelling fundamentals and starts with a series of economics and operations research perspectives. The second part (chapters 9-19) concentrates on modelling in electronic businesses and focuses on Management Information Systems and Decision Support Systems. The third part (chapters 20-22) centers on multidisciplinary business modelling progress, in particular on the seminal work of Professor Andrew B. Whinston.",

In today’s COVID-influenced volatile world, companies face a variety of challenges. And the most crucial of them are high levels of uncertainty and risk. Therefore, companies are constantly under pressure to provide sustainable solutions. Accordingly, previously gathered knowledge and information can be extremely helpful for this purpose. Hence, this fourth book of our subseries continues to accentuate on different approaches, which point to the importance of continuous progress in structural management for sustainable growth. It highlights the permanent gain and usage of information. We would be pleased if the book can stimulate further research on this subject matter.",

It reflects the developments in security technology, the convergence of the cyber and security worlds, and the fact that security management has become even more business focused. It covers newer topics like terrorism, violence, and cybercrime through various offence types such as commercial robbery and bribery. This handbook comprises mostly brand new chapters and a few thoroughly revised chapters, with discussions of the impact of the pandemic. It includes contributions from some of the world's leading scholars from an even broader geographic scale to critique the way security is provided and managed. It speaks to professionals working in security and students studying security-related courses.

    "description": "The book shows that the beginnings of the wars in 1939 and 2022—apart from political goals—had an event basis. Hitler liked to perform at the opera and therefore did not allow the destroyed Reichstag to be renovated for many years. Putin, in turn, prepared a victory parade in Kiev and ordered multi-meter banquet tables in Moscow. Hitler received solid military training and was initially very successful. Putin also wanted success, but he is only an officer of the secret political police, does not know the military and suffers defeat after defeat. Both Hitler and Putin used the available media and associated weapons of defamation: to insult and dehumanize the victim, and to accuse the opponent of the crimes they procured. This was intended to stop the West from helping. Hitler succeeded, but Putin did not. History repeated itself, but, as always, inaccurately. The book includes a translation of the full versions of the key propaganda texts that justify both wars. It is intended primarily for professional historians dealing with the beginning of World War II and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.",

    "description": "The Armistice of November 1918 ended four years of slaughter that left armies exhausted and populations weary of war – but the fighting was not over. In Russia, civil war and revolution had divided the nation and the Allies sought to intervene on behalf of the ‘White’ Russians against the Bolsheviks and this conflict continued long after the war had finished elsewhere in Europe. A vital source of information from inside the Bolshevik-held territory came from British secret agents in Petrograd, the main one being Paul Dukes. Known as the ‘Man of a Hundred Faces’, Dukes had managed to infiltrate both the Communist Party and the political police. The problem which faced the head of the British Secret Intelligence Service, Maurice Smith-Cummings, was getting Dukes’ information back to London. Carrying information overland was proving far too problematical, so Smith-Cummings hit upon the idea of using one of the Royal Navy’s new fast Coastal Motor Boat which was revealed just before the end of the war. He recruited Lieutenant Augustus Agar and through him he found five men, all unmarried, who could handle the two CMBs. Using an inlet on the Finnish coast as a base, Agar slipped past a series of forts, submerged breakwaters and the Russian Baltic Fleet to reach Petrograd and made contact with Dukes. A frequent courier service was soon established, with Agar carrying couriers in and out of Petrograd under the very noses of the Russians. So confident did Agar become, he even torpedoed the Russian cruiser Oleg. He followed this with support from Admiral Sir Walter Cowan in an all-out raid upon the Russian ships with eight larger CMBs and a bombing raid by the RAF. The raid resulted in the sinking of two battleships and the submarine depot ship Pamiet Azova. Agar was quietly given the Victoria Cross but told not to publish his memoirs until 1963. As for Paul Dukes, his cover was eventually blown, and he had to escape via Latvia in a number of hair-raising escapades. In 1920 he was knighted by King George V, who called Dukes the ‘greatest of all soldiers’. To this day, Dukes is the only person knighted based entirely on his exploits in espionage. This is their remarkable story.",

    "description": "FINALIST FOR THE 2024 GOTHAM BOOK PRIZE The devolution of the Sullivan Institute, from psychoanalytic organization to insular, radical cult. In the middle of the Ozzie and Harriet 1950s, the birth control pill was introduced and a maverick psychoanalytic institute, the Sullivan Institute for Research in Psychoanalysis, opened its doors in New York City. Its founders, Saul Newton and Jane Pearce, wanted to start a revolution, one grounded in ideals of creative expression, sexual liberation, and freedom from the expectations of society, and the revolution, they felt, needed to begin at home. Dismantling the nuclear family—and monogamous marriage—would free people from the repressive forces of their parents. In its first two decades, the movement attracted many brilliant, creative people as patients: the painter Jackson Pollock and a swarm of other abstract expressionist artists, the famed art critic Clement Greenberg, the singer Judy Collins, and the dancer Lucinda Childs. In the 1960s, the group evolved into an urban commune of three or four hundred people, with patients living with other patients, leading creative, polyamorous lives. But by the mid-1970s, under the leadership of Saul Newton, the Institute had devolved from a radical communal experiment into an insular cult, with therapists controlling virtually every aspect of their patients’ lives, from where they lived and the work they did to how often they saw their sexual partners and their children. Although the group was highly secretive during its lifetime and even after its dissolution in 1991, the noted journalist Alexander Stille has succeeded in reconstructing the inner life of a parallel world hidden in plain sight in the middle of Manhattan. Through countless interviews and personal papers, The Sullivanians reveals the nearly unbelievable story of a fallen utopia.",

They formed what became the Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp and stayed there for almost twenty years, in what would become the largest, most effective woman-led protest since the Suffrage campaign. Out of the Darkness reunites the women of Greenham to share their recollections of the highs and lows of camp life, explore how they organised, and uncover the non-violent ways they challenged military, police and cultural forces, all in the name of peace. Whether freeing MoD geese or dancing on silos, whether composing songs to put their cases across in court or kissing in the face of advancing police, this is the story of the power of creativity, wit and courage, and the sisterhood the Greenham women created. This book celebrates the Greenham pioneers of peaceful protest and hopes to inspire a new generation of activists.",

    "description": "Situates \"animal mobility\" within the politics of movement, opening new perspectives in the history of science. Human societies often come to know the natural world by examining animals, even as animals, frequently both willful and animate, can elude human grasps and challenge human aims. Animals and their movements have underpinned many methodological, moral, and epistemic dilemmas that generatively trouble the field. Featuring a range of geographies, species, languages, and cultures, the contributions in this volume broaden the view of the historical roles animals play in knowledge production processes. Organized according to three scales of animal movement (individuals, groups, systems), the twelve richly illustrated inquiries are situated in different time periods, from the sixteenth-century Ottoman Empire to the recent globalized past, and introduce varied forms, capacities, and politics of movement associated with animals. The analytic attention to animal mobility deepens comprehension of animal agency and human–animal interactions in unexpected spaces, including airports, entertainment venues, living rooms, dirt roads, and waterways. Taken together, the case studies in this volume reconsider how, where, and by whom science is done.",

    "description": "Euston Station was the first intercity railway gateway for London and with the famed Doric Arch became a major landmark of that city. Initially built for the London and Birmingham Railway, it became the terminus of the LNWR Premier Line, then HQ of the London Midland and Scottish. The controversial 1960’s demolition of the site stimulated the building preservation movement. Latterly we have a challenging on / off love affair with the area through the High Speed Two project. This book contains both a background history of Euston and its environs, combined with a modellers review of building a ‘OO’ gauge mid Victorian station complex. A core model of the old station was kindly donated to the Market Deeping Model Railway Club (MDMRC) following the sad act of vandalism of their model railway show in 2019. This in turn served as a stimulus to expand, detail and research during the Covid isolation and lockdown years. This book is the end result of these endeavours. We use the model to underpin the history and allow a geographical walkthrough of the site, plus hints, tips and techniques on building a landmark model. It has been an enjoyable and eye opening challenge to unveil the story under, through and over Euston. Written and contributed to by members of the MDMRC, all royalties will go the club.

    "description": "Andrea, Silvia, Ana, and Pamela were impoverished youth when the Sandinista revolution took hold in Nicaragua in 1979. Against the backdrop of a war and economic crisis, the revolution gave them hope of a better future — if not for themselves, then for their children. But, when it became clear that their hopes were in vain, they chose to emigrate. Children of the Revolution tells these four women's stories up to their adulthood in Italy. Laura J. Enríquez's compassionate account highlights the particularities of each woman's narrative, and shows how their lives were shaped by social factors such as their class, gender, race, ethnicity, and immigration status. These factors limited the options available to them, even as the women challenged the structures and violence surrounding them. By extending the story to include the children, and now grandchildren, of the four women, Enríquez demonstrates how their work abroad provided opportunities for their families that they themselves never had. Hence, these stories reveal that even when a revolution fails to fundamentally transform a society in a lasting way, seeds of change may yet take hold.",

Teaching back to earlier efforts to conceive of the international community in a less Eurocentric way, the volume proposes a tentative link between socialist internationalism as a political and cultural diplomatic principle in the Soviet Block and some new approaches to art and cultural historiography introduced there. In the \"Second World\", universal art history or Weltkunstgeschichte were endorsed as frameworks for the teaching and writing of art history. Authors in this book interrogate whether \"world art history\" as practiced by socialist scholars had aspirations and achievements comparable to today's Global Art History and World Art Studies. Or was this knowledge production in an internationalist paradigm a mere foil for communist rhetoric, behind which severed cultural relations to the Western world could also be recommenced?",

    "description": "An award-winning economic journalist on why the US dollar is positioned to maintain global primacy—and what that means for America and the world Prophecies that the dollar will lose its status as the world’s dominant currency have echoed for decades—and are increasing in volume. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts claim that Bitcoin or other blockchain-based monetary units will replace the dollar. Foreign policy hawks warn that China’s renminbi poses a lethal threat to the greenback. And sound money zealots predict that mounting US debt and inflation will surely erode the dollar’s value to the point of irrelevancy. Contra the doomsayers, Paul Blustein shows that the dollar’s standing atop the world’s currency pyramid is impregnable, barring catastrophic policy missteps by the US government. Recounting how the United States has wielded the dollar to impose devastating sanctions against adversaries, Blustein explains that although targets such as Russia have found ways to limit the damage, Washington’s financial weaponry will retain potency long into the future. His message, however, is that America must not be complacent about the dollar; the great power that its supremacy confers comes with commensurate responsibility.",

    "description": "This book examines the conditions under which the presence and use of militias result in an increase or a decrease in violence against civilians in intra-state conflicts. Showcasing the breadth and diversity of modern militias in the context of violence against civilians, the volume addresses the predation and repression that many such groups are infamous for, as well as increasingly important efforts by other militias at civilian protection in war-torn settings. The chapters examine militias from around the world, drawing on both qualitative and quantitative methods as they cover groups as varied as gangs, death squads, grassroots community-defense groups, official state militias, and party-sponsored armies – groups on the \"civic vice\" side, the \"civic virtue\" side, and the wide and mixed in-between space where most cases fall. Taken as a cohesive unit, the work lays the foundation for an encompassing theory and interrogation of the causal chain between militia type and operating context and the levels of violence against civilians. It provides path-breaking theory-building and empirical scholarship. Policymakers and national security practitioners dealing with issues relating to armed groups will also benefit from the practical issues covered here, such as how different forms of sponsorship and training affect militia behavior. This book will be of interest to students of civil wars, political violence, counterinsurgency, civil-military relations, and security studies in general.",

The content of this multidisciplinary book is organized into four large sections focusing on the histories and trajectories of urban spatial development, inequality and displacement of urban populations, contemporary debates on urban policies, and the future of the city in this region. Scholars of diverse origins and specializations analyze Latin American and Caribbean cities showing that, despite their diversity, they share many characteristics and challenges and that there is value in systematizing this knowledge to both understand and explain them better and to promote increasing equity and sustainability. The contributions in this handbook enhance the theoretical, empirical and methodological study of urbanization processes and urban policies of Latin America and the Caribbean in a global context, making it an important reference for scholars across the world. The book is designed to meet the interdisciplinary study and consultation needs of undergraduate and graduate students of architecture, urban design, urban planning, sociology, anthropology, political science, public administration, and more.",

    "description": "Bringing together a collection of essays by writers with diverse knowledge of the US criminal justice system, from those with personal experience in prison and on patrol to scholarly researchers, What Is a Criminal? explores the category of \"criminal\" through the human stories of those who bear and administer that label. This book performs a rare feat in bringing together the perspectives of justice-impacted people, those who work in law enforcement and social services, and scholarly researchers. Each chapter is a compelling narrative sharing the experience and perspective of a unique person with knowledge of the justice system. The first section, \"Incarceration, Reentry, and Rebuilding,\" gives a glimpse into the \"black box\" of prison, with firsthand accounts of daily life on the inside and the struggle to begin a new life after prison. Section 2, \"Journeys in Law Enforcement,\" presents perspectives from police officers, school resource officers, and corrections officers who are working to better their communities. The third section, \"Ripple Effects,\" addresses some of the broader impacts of the justice system, showing what it is like to be the child of an incarcerated parent, to be profiled, to be an undocumented immigrant, and to make art about the justice system. The final section, \"Scholarly Perspectives,\" is comprised of accessible articles by academics who study law and crime. Each chapter stands alone as an individual story, but taken together they provide a uniquely nuanced view of the US justice system. This book will be of interest to anyone who wants to know more about criminality, the US justice system, and the people involved in it. It is designed for a general audience, with accessible, compelling stories that will appeal to a variety of readers. It is an effective text for college and high school courses about crime and criminality, and provides excellent fodder for discussion in law enforcement and social services training programs or professional development workshops.",

In Auburn, New York, she entrusted passengers to Martha Coffin Wright, a Quaker abolitionist and leader of the women's rights movement, and Frances A. Seward, whose husband served as New York's governor and senator, and then as secretary of state under Abraham Lincoln. The Agitators opens in the 1820s, when Tubman is enslaved in Maryland and Wright and Seward are young homemakers in upstate New York, bound by law and tradition, and it ends after the Civil War. Many of the most prominent figures of the era-William H. Seward, Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Charles Sumner, John Brown, William Lloyd Garrison-are seen through the discerning eyes of the protagonists. So are the most explosive political debates: about the civil rights of African Americans and women, about the enlistment of Black troops, and about opposing interpretations of the Constitution. Wickenden traces the second American revolution these women fought to bring about and its lasting effects on the country. Profoundly relevant to our own time, The Agitators brings a vibrant, original voice to this transformative period in our history. Book jacket.",

Huxley (\"Darwin's Bulldog\") and his grandson, the scientist, conservationist, and zoologist Julian Huxley. Both T.H. and Julian suffered from depression, thinking and writing about the condition and genetic inheritance in highly curious ways. And between them, they communicated to the world the great modern story of the theory of evolution by natural selection. Because the grandson modeled himself so self-consciously on the grandfather, celebrated historian Alison Bashford writes seamlessly about these omnivorous intellects together, almost as if they were one very long-lived man whose vital dates bookended the colossal shifts in world history from the age of sail to the Space Age, and from colonial wars to world wars to the cold war. The myriad questions that the Huxleys grappled with make them the perfect dynasty-companions for time travel over the age of evolution: What is the nature of time and how old is the Earth itself? What is the connection between human history and natural history? How are humans animals and how are we not? What is the deep past and the distant future of humankind? Can and should we actively seek to improve future generations? What might the planet look like 10,000 years hence? This momentous biography traces the problems and wonders of the modern world that the Huxleys themselves raised, postured, and pondered over lives that spanned the age of evolution\"--",

From her humble beginnings in Oakland through her activist days at Howard University, Kamala Harris grew up to be tough, smart, quick-witted, demanding. You'll meet Harris the young prosecutor, who rose through the treacherous politics of San Francisco, and then of the state, to become the first Black female attorney general in California history. You'll discover Harris the risk-taker, who made the bold decision to run for Senate just five years into her tenure as attorney general. And you'll meet Harris the comeback queen, whose failure as a presidential candidate led to her brilliant behind-the-scenes campaign to land the all-important VP spot on Biden's ticket. Veteran journalist Dan Morain watched her ascent over his twenty-five years covering the state of California and delivers the first in-depth biography of her exceptional journey. Along the way, he reveals what Harris does when no one is looking: falling in love later in life, becoming a stepmother, and caring for little-known members of her longtime and informal political family, who always knew that \"Kamala's Way\" would land her on top.

    "description": "From an acclaimed, New York Times bestselling biographer, a timely reassessment of Abraham Lincoln's indispensable Secretary of the Treasury: a leading proponent for black rights both before and during his years in cabinet and later as Chief Justice of the United States. Salmon P. Chase is best remembered as a rival of Lincoln's for the Republican nomination in 1860--but there would not have been a national Republican Party, and Lincoln could not have won the presidency, were it not for the vital groundwork Chase laid over the previous two decades. Starting in the early 1840s, long before Lincoln was speaking out against slavery, Chase was forming and leading antislavery parties. He represented fugitive slaves so often in his law practice that he was known as the attorney general for runaway negroes, and he furthered his reputation as an outspoken federal senator and progressive governor of Ohio. Tapped by Lincoln to become Secretary of the Treasury, Chase would soon prove vital to the Civil War effort, raising the billions of dollars that allowed the Union to win the war, while also pressing the president to emancipate the country's slaves and recognize black rights. When Lincoln had the chance to appoint a chief justice in 1864, he chose his faithful rival, because he was sure Chase would make the right decisions on the difficult racial, political, and economic issues the Supreme Court would confront during Reconstruction. Drawing on previously overlooked sources, Walter Stahr sheds new light on a complex and fascinating political figure, as well as on the pivotal events of the Civil War and its aftermath. Salmon P. Chase tells the forgotten story of a man at the center of the fight for racial justice in 19th century America.",

Acker's life was as unruly and radical as her writing. Raised in a privileged but oppressive Upper East Side Jewish family, she turned her back on that world as soon as she could, seeking a life of romantic and intellectual adventure that led her to, and through, many of the most thrilling avant-garde and countercultural moments in America: the births of conceptual art and experimental music; the poetry wars of the 60s and 70s; the mainstreaming of hardcore porn; No Wave cinema and New Narrative writing; Riot grrls, biker chicks, cyberpunks. As this definitive biography shows, Acker was not just a singular writer, she was also a titanic cultural force who tied together disparate movements in literature, art, music, theatre, and film. A feat of literary biography, Eat Your Mind is the first full-scale, authorized life of Acker. .",

    "description": "Space is infinitely interesting! Space has both scientific and cultural currency because it has captured the imagination of human beings from ancient times until today. What seemed like science fiction centuries and only decades ago, is now science fact. Technological developments present and on the cusp are putting more and more of space into our hands. That is both exciting and frightening at the same time (think Lovecraft)! This book attempts to speak to the philosophical and ethical issues raised by space. Who owns space? Who should pay for space exploration and what is the impact on human beings on earth today? What happens if we’re not alone in the universe? What is the value and meaning of space exploration? What are the ethical implications of AI and Technology in relation to space exploration (what if they get away from us?!)? Questions! Questions! Questions! The Call for Chapters for this book Space, Philosophy and Ethics read: “For space science people, this conference is a platform to discuss the subconscious philosophical and ethical implications of their research that have been in the back of their minds while researching. For philosophers and non-specialists, it is an opportunity to learn together and struggle to find solutions for the philosophical and ethical quandaries that space science, exploration and technology present to humanity”. The approaches to space seem endless. Physics, as Aristotle discovered, inevitably leads to metaphysics, and metaphysics always have ethical concerns. The book loosely follows this outline. It begins and ends with the metaphysical implications of space, the spiritual, if you will. It leads with poetry. That seems appropriate since while we may ask many questions regarding space, we are likely to find very few answers. Then the book briefly looks at the ethical implications of AI and Technology for space exploration. There are chapters that deal with the material ethics of space commerce and ontology. Telos and Axiology (Value) are also explored. This book hopes to facilitate human struggle with the ethical implications of space rather than presuming to solve all its problems.",

    "description": "This book identifies scenarios for changes in transmission infrastructure, contracting, consumption patterns and fossil fuel financing policies, considering climate goals and the consequences of the conflict in Ukraine. The invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation has fundamentally changed the geopolitical situation, approaches to energy security issues, the EU’s energy (in)dependence and the implementation of previously outlined climate policies, including the planned gradual withdrawal from fossil fuels. This book presents the geopolitical architecture, energy mix, energy fuel supply structure, long-term energy policy and financing conditions of the oil and gas and sectors in the EU in the period preceding and following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The authors consider the date of Russia’s attack on Ukraine as a symbolic caesura marking the beginning of the process of creating a new energy order in the EU. A novel part of the book is the attention it pays to the role of the credit and investment policy of the EU banking sector in relation to carbon-intensive sectors and to the significance of the financial system from the point of view of the effectiveness of international sanctions imposed on the Russian Federation, including, above all, sanctions related to the fossil fuel sector. The book is of interest to researchers and all those interested in learning about these subjects.",

    "description": "In the recent decades, the emerging new molecular measurement techniques and their subsequent availability in chemical database has allowed easier retrieval of the associated data by the chemical analyst. Before the data revolution, most books focused either on mathematical modeling of chemical processes or exploratory chemometrics. Computational and Statistical Methods for Chemical Engineering aims to combine these two approaches and provide aspiring chemical engineers a single, comprehensive account of computational and statistical methods. The book consists of four parts: Part I discusses the necessary calculus, linear algebra, and probability background that the student may or may not have encountered before. Part II provides an overview on standard computational methods and approximation techniques useful for chemical engineering systems. Part III covers the most important statistical models, starting from simple measurement models, via linear models all the way to multivariate, non-linear stochiometric models. Part IV focuses on the importance of designed experiments and robust analyses. Each chapter is accompanied by an extensive selection of theoretical and practical exercises. The book can be used in combination with any modern computational environment, such as R, Python and MATLAB. Given its easy and free availability, the book includes a bonus chapter giving a simple introduction to R programming. This book is particularly suited for undergraduate students in Chemical Engineering who require a semester course in computational and statistical methods. The background chapters on calculus, linear algebra and probability make the book entirely self-contained. The book takes its examples from the field of chemistry and chemical engineering. In this way, it motivates the student to engage actively with the material and to master the techniques that have become crucial for the modern chemical engineer.",

    "description": "Revenge of the Microbes “What is antibiotic resistance, and why should I care?” Two decades after the first edition of Revenge of the Microbes: How Bacterial Resistance Is Undermining the Antibiotic Miracle warned of the looming threat of antibiotic resistance, it is now upon us. Not only has the spread of antibiotic resistance continued unabated, but the emergence of multidrug-resistant “superbugs” is poised to set medical progress back centuries. Several distinct biological, social, economic, and technological factors have resulted in us only barely keeping pace with these new threats. In this edition of Revenge of the Microbes, the authors detail the intricacies of the antibiotic-microbe arms race. Beginning with a historical perspective on antibiotics and their profound impact on both modern medicine and present-day society, they review our current arsenal against infectious diseases and the various ways pathogens evade or overcome them. The authors examine the practices and policies driving the discovery and development of new antibiotics, what happens to antibiotics once they are released into the environment, how antibiotic-resistant bacteria evolve and spread, and the urgency for finding alternative approaches to combating infections. This discussion of the controversies surrounding antibiotics will empower readers—citizen scientists, policy makers, pharmaceutical researchers, and medical professionals alike—to generate informed opinions on antibiotic usage and stewardship as we contend with fewer effective antibiotics. Reader-friendly and comprehensible, this new edition of Revenge of the Microbes engages a diverse audience of scientists, clinicians, educators, students, lawyers, environmentalists, and public health advocates as it explores the ever-changing landscape of the antibiotic resistance crisis. For anyone interested in antimicrobial resistance (AMR), this is a completely approachable 360-degree view of a very complex topic. The authors don’t dilute the science but manage to deliver it in language and examples that everyone can digest. Don’t miss the “Points to Ponder” at the end of each chapter. These thought-provoking nuggets will inspire creative thinking even in the most experienced AMR authorities. — JEAN B. PATEL, PhD, D(ABMM), Principle Scientist, Scientific Affairs, Microbiology, Beckman Coulter; former Science Team Lead, Antibiotic Resistance Coordination and Strategy Unit, CDC Revenge of the Microbes: How Bacterial Resistance Is Undermining the Antibiotic Miracle, 2nd edition, by Brenda A. Wilson and Brian T. Ho, is an intriguing and detailed narrative of the history of antibiotics, the mechanisms by which bacteria become resistant, and the spread of antibacterial resistance across the globe (Figure). The second edition comes at a critical time. While the attention of the general public, medical communities, and pharmaceutical companies is understandably focused on the development of vaccines and antivirals in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, this book shifts attention back to the ongoing crisis of antibiotic resistance. The authors present readers with points to ponder, summarizing critical facts and discoveries while highlighting important unanswered questions at the conclusion of each chapter. That section provides an opportunity to pause, digest the material, and critically consider the potential impact of the “revenge of the microbes.” Revenge of the Microbes offers an insightful examination of a critical global public health threat. This text succinctly meets the objectives outlined in the preface, focusing on “bridging the informational divide by presenting a more holistic view of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance.” This book offers the opportunity for a general audience, including students, educators, scientists, medical professionals, and concerned citizens, to gain an appreciation for the successes of antibiotics and understand the intricacies of antibiotic use and stewardship.

Metropolitan London has around 7,000 public houses – an average of 25 pubs per square mile. No other capital city in the world matches this density. It’s not surprising that the London pub is such an institution at home and abroad! Pubs were part and parcel of the expansion of London – that grew to be the world’s largest city by the 1830s. Because pubs are omnipresent in the capital, a pub can always be found near a place of historical significance. This book selects some key moments in the history of London, from Roman times to the modern day, and suggests a popular pub nearby to savour the moment - re-living the history with a drink in hand! The Pub Lover’s Guide to London explains the driving forces behind the most significant moments in the history of London - and the best pubs near to where history was made. In all, 52 great pubs to visit - one for each week of the year!",

    "description": "This book is one of the first edited volumes on the current Israel/Palestine conflict—the Gaza Nakba 2023–24. It contains contributions from both young post-doctoral researchers and more seasoned scholars from Japan. These authors, with their rich experience of field work in the region and their interdisciplinary approaches, are able to provide critical analyses on the current breakdown of humanitarian norms, the dysfunctional state of international organizations, and the breakdown of conflict management and peace-building. The unique viewpoints of Japanese scholars are shared regarding their understanding of the critical developments in Gaza since October 7, 2023. Further, these chapters analyze the background of the conflict, focusing on popular sentiments, national identity, and historical memory in Israel/Palestine, and the importance of space and land as national and cultural symbols, using rich and updated written and visualdata from the region. This work significantly challenges prevailing arguments, as it avoids stereotyped understandings of the persistence of religious and ethnic hatred, the proxy relationships of global powers (e.g., USA) and regional ones (Iran), and regional rivalries over geopolitical and economic interests in the Middle East. Such arguments as these provide no more than a quick divide-and-rule type of solution, encouraging merely superficial diplomatic coordination among the major global powers rather than a real solution. Alternatively, this book provides a new framework for understanding the structure of the conflict, making way for solving the problem from the popular level, and delving deeply into reconsideration of the durability or non-durability of the state system in the Middle East and a Western originated liberal international order and norm in general. The book also discloses the severe reality that human rights in the Global South are often neglected. In this sense, the purpose of this work is to disclose the significance of the Gaza War as an iconic event which reveals all the contradictions, inequalities and injustices in a global historical context. This book is essential for anyone who wants a fresh and expert consideration of the Israel-Palestine-Gaza issue, which avoids the often parochial stereotypes that attend it in the West, and which views it through a global lens.

    "description": "The humble pub has played a central role in London's history across centuries. Over time, many old favourites have been lost because of the ever-evolving landscape of the city and changing trends and habits. For the first time in print, Sam Cullen looks back at a selection of 200+ London pubs which have closed in the last twenty-five years. Thanks to extensive research taking in newspaper articles, historic books and even conversations with former patrons of these establishments, this book presents some of the most memorable London boozers we've lost in recent years. London’s Lost Pubs leads readers on a borough-by-borough guided tour of the city, visiting everything from the old haunts of Chelsea bohemians and City workers to favourites on legendary London streets from the Old Kent Road to Fleet Street. Each featured pub’s listing includes interesting facts and quirky trivia which will bring a smile to readers’ faces, while also reminding just how much London pubs can reveal about the city’s history. Along the way, readers will encounter pubs which boasted pets, pools and even pythons! The book is also illustrated throughout with both archive and current photos. London’s Lost Pubs is an essential read for fans and scholars of local history as well as honouring and celebrating countless colourful pubs which have played a pivotal role in the city’s life. * ‘A fascinating directory of the all-too-many pubs this city has lost’ - Londonist * ‘Despite the sad subject matter, this story of London pubs now gone is a thoroughly absorbing read. The accounts and anecdotes are wittily told and bring to mind just how varied, diverse and wonderful London pubs are.’ - Jane Jepchote, Chair of London Pubs Group, CAMRA",

Including solid statistical data expressing freedom, violence, and governmental orientation. Consideration is given to the evolving relationships with the United States and other Latin American nations. Revisions have also addressed new historical interpretations, for example, of the history of Mexico and latest political changes, for example, in Venezuela and Cuba. Maps, charts, and photographs provide extensive visual expressions of the region, its geography, peoples, and cultures, in particular public architecture, agricultural technology, specular geology, and striking diversity. The images offer a narrative of the multiplicity of peoples as demonstrated in their clothing, economic and everyday activities, their physical surroundings. Consequently, the narrative combines global economics, national politics, and daily social life throughout the region. The chapters can be read as individual histories for each of the countries, within the context created by contrasts and similarities with the other nations of Latin America.",

The handbook is organized around seven themes: arts and planning for equity and social development; incorporating culture in urban planning; the intersection of creative and cultural industries and tourism planning; financing; public buildings, public space and public art; cultural heritage planning; and culture and the climate crisis. Urban planners are often tasked with preserving and attracting new art and culture to a city, but there are no common rules on how practitioners accomplish this work. This handbook will be an invaluable resource for city planners and designers, cultural workers, elected officials, artists, and social justice workers and advocates seeking to integrate creativity and culture into urban planning.",

Approximately one-third of the book is devoted to Russia. The remainder of the book is comprised of separate chapters on Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. The text focuses heavily on recent economic and political developments within these twelve states. Each country chapter offers descriptions and overviews of the respective governmental institutions, key leaders, civil society dynamics, and economic conditions within each state. It supplements this focus with shorter sections dealing with historical developments, demographics, foreign policy, and cultural elements. Each chapter concludes with brief projections of future developments within each state. The combination of factual accuracy and up-to-date detail along with its informed projections make this an outstanding resource for students, researchers, practitioners in international development, media professionals, government officials, and potential investors.",

    "description": "Was in der Welt gelten oder als Tatbestand verbürgt sein soll, muss aktenkundig sein, denn die Behörden der ›verwalteten Welt‹ entscheiden über unsere Wirklichkeit, Identität und Handlungsmacht im ›Medium‹ der Akten. Diese stiften also zuletzt Zusammenhänge zwischen Amt und Welt, zunächst aber zwischen unterschiedlichsten Schriftstücken – egal, ob in Gestalt von Kästchen und Kisten, von Bündeln, Kladden oder Ordnern, zunehmend in Form von verschalteten Datensätzen und elektronischen Verweissystemen. Akten lassen sich deshalb als Medien verstehen, die unterschiedliche Formen der Inskription miteinander verbinden. Acta sind Arbeitsmittel, Handlungen und zugleich Medien der (Auto-)Protokollierung eines administrativen Vorgangs, in welcher Doppelfunktion sie die Rechenschaftspflicht der Verwaltungen ebenso zu erfüllen helfen, wie sie eine historiographische Dokumentation ihres Tuns ermöglichen. Als Aufschreibesystem mit spezifischem Prozesscharakter, das unablässige Rekursion mit weitreichenden Handlungsketten verbindet, waren Akten seit ihrem Aufkommen in der Frühneuzeit eine medientechnische Innovation – und sind es noch heute, im Zeitalter ihrer ›Digitalisierung‹. Dabei sind diese keineswegs nur Sache der Verwaltung: Die Geschichten der Akte/n in diesem (Open Access-)Band der AdminiStudies handeln auch von einer Mediengeschichte der Migration der ›Aktenmäßigkeit‹ in pädagogische oder medizinische, politische, militärische oder wirtschaftliche Organisationen sowie technische Bereiche und künstlerisch-literarische Domänen.",

Deren thematische und poetische Tendenzen werden hier unter der Leitfrage neuer Paradigmen diskutiert, die ja nicht nur im literaturwissenschaftlichen Diskurs formiert werden, der über Texte spricht, sondern auch in den literarischen Texten selbst. So fällt das Phänomen verbreiteter Mythisierungen bzw. Remythisierungen ebenso auf wie die stark zunehmende Literarisierung von Neuen Medien und von Biowis-senschaften, die auf Innovationen anderer Medien und Disziplinen reagiert. Zudem ist, angesichts der seit einigen Jahren neu erfolgenden literarischen Auseinandersetzung mit der deutschen und europäischen Geschichte, die Frage nach dem Ende der Nachkriegsliteratur noch einmal neu zu stellen. Auf diesen vier Schauplätzen hat die Literatur von Harry Mulisch, Marcel Beyer, Rainald Goetz, Durs Grünbein, Tanja Dückers, W. G. Sebald, Sarah Kane, Jeffrey Eugenides, Joane Rowlings, Elfriede Jelinek, Aris Fioretos u.v.a. ihren Auftritt.",

    "description": "This is an open access book. With the progress of social civilization, social science and its research are becoming more and more important. Theoretically and practically, the study of social phenomena and social problems and the development of prosperous social sciences are the eternal themes of human beings. At present, social science research and its results can hardly meet the needs of social development, especially the unscientific evaluation of social science results, which has aroused great concern from all walks of life, and has produced dirt and questions on social science, thus affecting the proper development of social science. Max Weber once said that \"the most important function of social science in modern times is to keep people \"clear-headed\" and to resist the delusions of \"prophetic legislators\". \" Humanities and arts are the process of perceiving, realizing, thinking, manipulating, and expressing objective or subjective objects through capturing and excavating, feeling and analyzing, integrating and applying, or displaying the stage results in the form obtained through feeling (seeing, hearing, smelling, touching). The social sciences and humanities and arts contain content that will directly affect our lives and the way society functions. And by reacting to today's increasingly intricate problems and situations through systematic and professional discussions, they will further contribute to the improvement of institutions and the development of society. By thinking about issues and looking at problems and the world from different perspectives by putting the two together, it may be possible to have more comprehensive, appropriate, and better responses; for example, the development of laws requires a deeper understanding of the environment in which they are implemented; international trade requires a certain understanding of the customs of different countries; and the development of tax and economic policies requires a certain understanding of the population, consumer demand, etc.",

    "description": "The Munich-based Carl Hanser Verlag was one of the most important publishers in the 1950s and 1960s when it came to promoting Polish literature in West Germany. The fact that – from the 1950s onwards (after a period of German classics' editions) – the Hanser Verlag focused also on Polish literature seems to be baffling. However, this decision was all the more important, because Polish literature in translation often built bridges to Poland's neighbors after the end of World War II and paved the way for a new phase in the German-Polish dialogue aimed at reconciliation. This publishing policy was maintained over the following decades. Daniel Pietrek analyzes and describes this unique cultural transfer in his study.",

    "description": "A biography of the life and work of groundbreaking developmental psychologist Carol Gilligan, intended for high school age readers, part of the APA's Extraordinary Women in Psychology Series. Carol Gilligan has devoted her life to discovering, uncovering, and recovering voices belonging to girls and women, as well as boys and men. Through her work, she has played an enormous role in reconceptualizing traditionally held views on moral and identity development in young people, most prominently in her landmark 1982 book detailing her ethic of care model, In a Different Voice (coined by Harvard University Press as “The little book that started a revolution”). Drawing on source material that includes interviews with Gilligan as well as her own writings in books and articles, this book offers young readers not only the opportunity to learn about a pioneering psychologist and her momentous work, but also for them to consider the potential power of their own voices as they go forward in life.",
